Here’s a simple first-version concept you can build and test: a minimal “Storage Tracker” app that records containers and the items inside them, with photos, barcodes, and time-in-storage, plus basic search by picture, use, and name.

Core features (v1)
- Add container
  - Name/ID (e.g., “Bin A1”)
  - Location (e.g., “Storage Unit 12”)
  - Optional barcode/QR code for the container
- Add item
  - Item name
  - Use/category (e.g., “camping,” “kitchen,” “tools”)
  - Photo (item photo)
  - Container assignment (which bin it’s in)
  - Date stored (auto-captured)
  - Optional item barcode/QR
- Search and filter
  - By item name (text)
  - By use/category (filter)
  - By image similarity (basic: show items with visually similar thumbnails; toy version: pick from tagged keywords or a simple “looks like” selection)
- Item age
  - Show “days in storage” based on date stored
- Scan view
  - Scan a container barcode to list its items

Data model (toy version)
- Container: {id, name, location, barcode, createdAt}
- Item: {id, name, use, photoUrl, containerId, itemBarcode, storedAt}

Toy example dataset
Containers:
- C1: {id: "C1", name: "Bin A1", location: "Storage Unit 12", barcode: "123456", createdAt: 2025-09-01}
- C2: {id: "C2", name: "Bin B2", location: "Storage Unit 12", barcode: "789012", createdAt: 2025-09-01}

Items:
- I1: {id: "I1", name: "Camping Stove", use: "camping", photoUrl: "/img/camping_stove.jpg", containerId: "C1", itemBarcode: "STV001", storedAt: 2025-09-10}
- I2: {id: "I2", name: "Enamel Mugs (x4)", use: "camping", photoUrl: "/img/mugs.jpg", containerId: "C1", itemBarcode: "MUG004", storedAt: 2025-09-10}
- I3: {id: "I3", name: "Socket Wrench Set", use: "tools", photoUrl: "/img/wrench_set.jpg", containerId: "C2", itemBarcode: "TL002", storedAt: 2025-09-12}
- I4: {id: "I4", name: "Winter Blanket", use: "household", photoUrl: "/img/blanket.jpg", containerId: "C2", itemBarcode: "BLK001", storedAt: 2025-09-12}

Example user flows
- Add a container:
  - Tap “Add Container” → Name: “Bin A1” → Scan/enter barcode “123456” → Save
- Add an item:
  - Tap “Add Item” → Name: “Camping Stove” → Use: “camping”
  - Take photo of the item
  - Assign container: “Bin A1”
  - Auto-set storedAt = today
  - Save
- Search:
  - “camping” → returns I1, I2
  - “wrench” → returns I3
  - Filter by Use = “household” → returns I4
  - Scan container barcode “789012” → lists I3, I4
- See time in storage:
  - For I1 stored 2025-09-10, if today is 2025-10-05 → 25 days in storage

Toy UI sketch (screens)
- Home: Search bar; filters (Use); “Scan” button; list of recent items with photo thumbnails and “days in storage.”
- Containers: List of containers; tap to view items inside; “Scan Container” to jump directly.
- Add Item: fields for name, use, container picker, photo capture, optional barcode scan.
- Item Detail: large photo, name, use, container, barcode, stored date, days in storage, move item to another container.

Basic search logic
- Text search: lowercased contains on name and use.
- Category filter: exact match on use.
- Picture search (toy): choose a reference image from your saved items; return items with the same use or with simple tag overlap (e.g., “metal,” “cookware”). For a true image search later, integrate a local/mobile embedding model or a cloud vision API.

Sample JSON seed (you can import into a simple local app or mock server)
{
  "containers": [
    {"id":"C1","name":"Bin A1","location":"Storage Unit 12","barcode":"123456","createdAt":"2025-09-01"},
    {"id":"C2","name":"Bin B2","location":"Storage Unit 12","barcode":"789012","createdAt":"2025-09-01"}
  ],
  "items": [
    {"id":"I1","name":"Camping Stove","use":"camping","photoUrl":"/img/camping_stove.jpg","containerId":"C1","itemBarcode":"STV001","storedAt":"2025-09-10"},
    {"id":"I2","name":"Enamel Mugs (x4)","use":"camping","photoUrl":"/img/mugs.jpg","containerId":"C1","itemBarcode":"MUG004","storedAt":"2025-09-10"},
    {"id":"I3","name":"Socket Wrench Set","use":"tools","photoUrl":"/img/wrench_set.jpg","containerId":"C2","itemBarcode":"TL002","storedAt":"2025-09-12"},
    {"id":"I4","name":"Winter Blanket","use":"household","photoUrl":"/img/blanket.jpg","containerId":"C2","itemBarcode":"BLK001","storedAt":"2025-09-12"}
  ]
}

Minimal implementation path
- Platform: pick one (Flutter, React Native, SwiftUI, or a low-code tool like Glide/Airtable for a fast prototype).
- Storage: local (SQLite) or simple backend (Firebase/Firestore or Supabase).
- Image capture: device camera; store files locally or in cloud storage with public URLs.
- Barcode: use built-in camera scanning libraries (e.g., MLKit, VisionKit, ZXing).
- “Days in storage” = floor((today - storedAt) / 86400000).

Stretch ideas (later)
- True visual search using image embeddings.
- QR labels printing for containers and items.
- Multi-location support; move history and audit log.
- Shareable access and roles.
- Reminders for items exceeding X days in storage.
- Offline-first sync.

If you tell me your preferred platform, I can provide starter code and the exact schema/setup for that stack.
